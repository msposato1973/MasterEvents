# MasterEvents

The task includes implementing a client, com.fsbtech.interviews.Client, using the entities supplied under the package com.fsbtech.interviews.entities. The Client interface has comments explaining the functionality required by each method.

To keep the task in its time limitation we require the data to be only in-memory and no write to secondary resource (file, database) is required.

## Some notes on the data structure:

## Category corresponds to a type of a sport
E.g. “Football”, “Tennis”
Each Category has many SubCategory
E.g. in Football, “Premier League” or “Champions League”
E.g. in Tennis, “French Open” or “Wimbledon”
Each SubCategory has many Event
E.g. in Football, “Manchester United v Arsenal”
E.g. in Tennis, “Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic”
Each Event has many different betting markets, each represented by a MarketRefType
E.g. in Football, “Home/Draw/Away” for betting on the final outcome of the match
E.g. in Tennis, “Home/Away” for betting on the winner
The client is used for both managing and retrieving the data. For instance;

## Adding new Event
- Updating an Event as complete
- Add / remove MarketRefType to / from an Event
- Retrieve a list of Event objects based on filters (e.g. all Events with a “Home/Draw/Away” market, regardless of the Category)
- Return the entire data structure as formatted output
- Once an Event has completed, it is no longer of any relevance to the client. Similarly, a SubCategory with no valid events is also of no relevance to the client. Before you start to write your solution:

## Make sure your code is clear and efficient
- The solution should handle both basic and edge cases
- The solution should provide good test coverage
- Will it work for multi-threaded environment?
- Feel free to add methods and classes as well as change content of methods (e.g. validation) but do not change existing structure (e.g. setters instead of final members). Make sure the solution uses an efficient storage structure.

Good Luck!
